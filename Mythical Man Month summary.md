# Chapter 1: The Tar Pit

- large Programming projects suffer management problems different in kind from small ones => It looks similar with an animal cauth in a tar pit can't escape. (Though they try to escape it makes them more difficult to escape)
- There is not one cause for lage projects to enter the "tar pit"
- Program : ready to be run by the author(developer) on the system on which it was developed.
- A program can be converted into a more useful, but more costly object such as programming system, product.
- Programming Product: a program that can be run, test, repair etc by anybody => for doing this, programming product must be written in generalized fashion so it takes at least 3 times bigger than programming.
- Programming System: a collection of interacting programs. It is written to fit in interface. It also cost at least 3 times bigger than stand-alone program
- Pleasure of making things that are useful to other people => programming! + joy of learning
- Bad about the craft: one harm can infect the whole system. Reveiwing other's code is not happy.

# Chapter 2: They Mythical man-Month

- Most fail on Software project => time estimating!
- Because of lack of estimating skill and confusing: we assumes that men and months are interchangeable.
- Some software manager's stubbornness make estimating much harder.
- Most programmers think they are optimists and the code will work well. "I just found the last bug"
- incompleteness, inconsistencies only occurs once we begin implementation
- the man-month as a unit for measuring the size of a job is a dangerous and deceptive myth.
- Brooks's Law : Number of man does not gurantee the speed of work. Adding manpower to a late software project makes it even later. Communication overhead matters!
- Test/debug time consumes a lot because of unexpected errors.
- 1/3 planning 1/6 codding 1/4 component test and early system tesy 1/3 system test, all components in hand
- => test takes almost half of the developing!
